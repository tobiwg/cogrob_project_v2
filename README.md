## Description

### Alligator Egg Collection Robot
In commercial alligator farms, the harvesting of alligator eggs is a costly and dangerous operation. In existing solutions, human operators are typically suspended in the air and descended into the desired location using helicopters. The present project aims to develop a cognitive robot capable of harvesting alligator eggs.

This repository contains code to control a robot designed to collect alligator eggs. The robot is equipped with a custom end effector designed to gently pick up and transport alligator eggs without damaging them.

The code in this repository is written in Python and runs on the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. It includes scripts to control the robot's movement, operate the end effector, and perform image recognition to detect the location of alligator eggs.

Please note that the collection of alligator eggs is illegal in many areas and can have serious consequences for both the individual and the environment. The use of this code for illegal or unethical purposes is strictly prohibited. The owners and contributors of this repository assume no liability for any damages or legal repercussions resulting from the use of this code.

This code was developed as part of a research project aimed at studying the impact of alligator egg collection on alligator populations. The robot is intended to provide a safer and more efficient method of collecting alligator eggs for research purposes, without putting human researchers or alligator populations at risk.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the use of this code, please refer to the warning message in the repository or contact the repository owners for more information.

## Installation

To use this package, you must first install ROS1 (noetic) and the MoveIt framework. Refer to the [MoveIt installation guide](https://moveit.ros.org/install/) for instructions.

After installation, download this package and place the `startup` folder under `ws_moveit/src`. 

Then, take the two files in the `replace` folder and place them in `ws_moveit/src/panda_moveit_config/launch`, replacing the original files.

Next, navigate to the `ws_moveit/src/startup/scripts` folder and run the following three commands:
```
chmod +x vision.py
chmod +x move_group_python_interface.py
chmod +x display_images_test.py
```
Return to the `ws_moveit` folder and run the following command:
```
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

Finally, run the following command to launch the package:
```
rosrun startup start.launch
```
